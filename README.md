this is a repository i made on a whim \
i'm interested in learning computer graphics for the web, and WebGPU seemed like an exciting place to start

eventually i might encounter a roadblock and stop out of nowhere, which is why i'm calling this a throwaway \
if I push changes here long enough maybe i'll change that

i'm currently (very loosely) following [webgpufundamentals.org's](https://webgpufundamentals.org) tutorial in `script.js`

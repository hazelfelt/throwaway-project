this is a repository i made on a whim \
i'm interested in learning computer graphics for the web, and WebGPU seemed like an exciting place to start

---

eventually i might encounter a roadblock and stop out of nowhere, which is why i'm calling this a throwaway \

if I have a more concrete direction for this project maybe I'll change the name. \
but for now, it's just me messing around and learning.

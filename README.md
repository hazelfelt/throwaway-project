this is a repository I've made on a whim

i'm interested in learning how to do computer graphics on the web, and WebGPU seemed like an exciting place to start

i might just reach a roadblock and stop out of nowhere, which is why i'm calling this a throwaway

maybe i'll change that if I push changes here long enough
